# Learn-Electronics
My objective with this repository is to share with you what I know about electronics. Currently I'm a student, so I'm still learning, but I believe I can make a contribution for those who are just starting out.

## Electronics?
First at all, I want you to have a map in your mind, and as if it were a puzzle, we could organize electronics in following areas:

| Fields             | About                                                                                         |
|:------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|EDA                 |You could work developing all those softwares use for analyse, build hardware                  |
|Integrated Circuits |Also known as Microelectronics. You'll be able to design and build a microprocessor, ISA, memories and so on. The theory of circuits is focused on building these devices.|
|Embedded Systems    |When you're using and Arduino, or a development board with a microcontroller or an FPGA. Also when you design an specific purpose processor. All the theory of circuits applied here is related with designing PCBs for specific ICs, or with power electronics applicaciontes, control systems, communication systems, among others|
|Fablab              |The also know "maker space". When you work with a 3D printer and do prototyping                |
|Recycling           |When you use electronics of discarded devices to build amazing gadget to your room, house, etc.|
